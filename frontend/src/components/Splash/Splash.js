            BidLite is a web application designed to help small scale plumbers
            and electricians bid jobs within a matter of seconds.
          </h3>
          <h3 className="about-blurb">
            The first component of BidLite is a user's completed job list. When
            a job is completed, the user should input the ACTUAL COMPLETED JOB
            COST into the list. The user should NOT enter bid prices into the
            completed jobs list as that will create an inaccurate bid machine
            overtime.
          </h3>
          <h3 className="about-blurb">
            The second component of BidLite is the bid machine which uses all of
            the completed jobs in the completed job list to determine an average
            cost per fixture. This means that with each complete job list entry,
            the bid machine becomes more accurate. Lastly, there are factors
            that can be added to the bid machine to help users fine tune their
            bids for specific jobs in order to account for unique situations.
