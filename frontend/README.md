# Welcome to the BidLite README!

BidLite is a web application built to help small scale plumbers bid jobs quickly. The genesis of BidLite came from the need for small scale plumbing companies to speed up bid time. As a small scale plumber, more time spend bidding jobs means more time not working at your hourly rate. At the same time, an accurate bid is extremely important because the company may lose money on a bid or bid themselves out of a job without an accurate bid.

This is where BidLite really gets to work! BidLite consists of two parts, the bid machine and the user's job list.
